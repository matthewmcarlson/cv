% so for the biggest thing for the resume is organizing with a clear structure
% I like bullet points but you could do it with alignment too
% I would make the section titles smaller and bold the job titles
% You dont need your highschool on there and if you are applying out of state I might take off your address
% If you liked my format I have a blank one I can send to you
% https://www.dropbox.com/s/hxzn9gdrfflb2zt/resume_final.doc?dl=0

% ea that is impressive you could mention it in employment though
% I think you have enough impressive stuff as it is
% I would take this off 

% You dont need last updated either
% Was in charge
% Change this to an action verb

% Also I would dumb down your resume if youre sending it to HR
% because even I have no idea what some of this means
% they will probably look for buzz words
% if you are sending it directly to managers then thats good
% yea the bullets already make it look a ton better I would work on the font too though. 

% I would move out the margins on the side
% and increase them on the top and bottom

% Try to make your bullet points about achievements rather than duties, include numbers wherever possible.

% or am actively involved in
% I would take that out
% and give the number of projects youve lead or been a part of leading
% solid numbers

% Operations supervisor, -> Supervisor
% take this out– Gave tours and ran labs to visitors from the public
% – Some coding, mostly HTML and CSS 
% rewrite to
% Maintain college websites using html and css?
